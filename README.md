# Morpheus

Michael Oberberger's collection of useful, generalized code.

This library was started in .NET 1.0. It was officially named "Morpheus" when I saw the Matrix movie. Like there was any question.

If you're reading this, you have access to my private repo. Please respect my decision to keep all of this code private.
